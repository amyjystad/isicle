ISiCLE
======

Overview
--------
ISiCLE, or the _in silico_ chemical library engine, is a pipeline for high-accuracy chemical property calculation. ISiCLE takes an [InChI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Chemical_Identifier) or [SMILES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_molecular-input_line-entry_system) string as input, generates an initial 3D conformation, and subsequently optimizes this initial structure through molecular dynamics simulations and quantum chemistry optimizations. Finally, ISiCLE simulates desired properties (e.g. collision cross section, NMR chemical shifts) for each conformer yielded during molecular dynamics simulations to produce a single value, Boltzmann-weighted by relative Gibb's free energy, giving emphasis to properties from highly probable conformations.

ISiCLE is implemented using the [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io) workflow management system, enabling scalability, portability, provenance, fault tolerance, and automatic job restarting. Snakemake provides a readable Python-based workflow definition language and execution environment that scales, without modification, from single-core workstations to compute clusters through as-available job queuing based on a task dependency graph.

Installation
------------
Use [``conda``](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) to create a new virtual environment with required dependencies:
```bash
conda create -n isicle -c conda-forge -c bioconda -c ambermd python=3.7 openbabel=2.4.1 rdkit ambertools snakemake numpy pandas yaml statsmodels
```

Additionally, ensure the following third-party software is installed and added to your ``PATH``:
* [cxcalc](https://chemaxon.com/products/marvin/download) (license required)
* [NWChem](http://www.nwchem-sw.org/index.php/Download) (not required for ``ccs lite``)

Activate the virtual environment:
```
conda activate isicle
```

Install ISiCLE using [``pip``](https://pypi.org/project/pip/):
```bash
# clone/install
git clone https://github.com/pnnl/isicle.git
pip install isicle/

# direct
pip install git+https://github.com/pnnl/isicle
```

Citing ISiCLE
-------------
If you would like to reference ISiCLE in an academic paper, we ask you include the following references:

The first describes ISiCLE for CCS, the second describes ISiCLE for NMR chemical shifts, and the third is to cite the software package (update version and access date appropriately).
